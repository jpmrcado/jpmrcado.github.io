            What is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a
            type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
            versions of
            Lorem Ipsum.


            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its
            layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed to
            using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
            and web
            page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
            many web
            sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
            on
            purpose (injected humour and the like).What is Lorem Ipsum?
